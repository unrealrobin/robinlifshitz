### Summary

A few years ago, I decided to take a real chance, to stop thinking about making games and start building them. What began as curiosity turned into a full pursuit of learning how systems, design, and technology come together to create meaningful play.

Now, I’m a Gameplay Engineer and Technical Game Designer focused on turning design intent into elegant, practical software architecture. I work primarily in C++ and Unreal Engine, building gameplay systems and features that are scalable, performant, and easy for teams to iterate on. My favorite problems are the ones where good engineering directly improves player enjoyment and speeds up developer iteration.

Day to day, I design mechanics and systems, prototype and iterate in engine, gather user feedback, and do tuning & balancing to tighten the feel. I collaborate in cross-disciplinary, agile teams and keep my process feedback-oriented. I love clear docs, small testable slices, and steady improvements that ship.

Big picture, I care about connecting people through technology. Beyond my current game work, I’m exploring a long-term vision called The Shire (LOTR superfan) a shared hub that links identity, social systems, and game experiences into one cohesive ecosystem.

Always learning, always improving and always building systems that make play feel great.

Summary:
Project Hail Mary is project where I explore more niche game developer roles and dive deeper into the most advanced systems UE has to offer. Though not tied to a specific game, these smaller projects have pushed me to explore more specific roles that game developers hold.

Systems
1. Gameplay Ability System
2. Networked Game Play
3. Runtime Ability Telegraph Editor
4. And more to come...
